      <description>If you are building any of these, you should definitely consider applying for a grant on Questbook.
Finance Discounts &amp;amp; Deals based on shopping history Shopping history has historically been proprietary information owned by the platform where the user did the shopping, like Amazon, Shopify, Ebay. However new applications can be built which poaches customers from other platforms by giving discounts and deals to power shoppers - by using reclaim Protocol to import shopping history.</description>

      <description>Madhavan (Mads) Malolan Which side is up? Captchas are getting so hard that only AIs will be able to solve it. The key premise of this post is that it is getting increasingly important for AI agents to be able to access web products on behalf of the user. Captchas are an antipattern. They are not any good at keeping AI bots out anyway, at the same time they&amp;rsquo;re detrimental to productivity.</description>

      <description>Chainlink, but for long tail data sources.
Data Guilds A data guild is a DAO setup on chain to source certain data feeds. For example, there may be a Data Guild for Weather in Mumbai, another for NBA scores etc.
In this DAO, there are two key participants.
Subscribers - who use the data feeds Oracles - who provide the data onchain Coins Each Data Guild has its own coin. This coin governs the data feeds coming on chain.</description>

      <description>Most people assume that to generate proofs using Reclaim Protocol, you need to install a chrome extension or a mobile app. This is true for most zk-tls solutions out there, including Reclaim Protocol until early 2024. Not any more.
All that you need is a mobile phone. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to install anything on it. You just scan a QR code, and the Reclaim Protocol proof generation starts.
Check out the Demo Appclips and InstantApps Appclips and InstantApps are mini apps that can be opened on iOS and Android respectively without having to install an app.</description>

      <title>Duplication Counting : Ensuring one proof is used only once, without doxxing the user</title>

      <description>Introduction For many applications, it will be critical that multiple users are not able to claim the same credential, at least without being detected. For example, suppose a user proves they own some funds in a certain bank account, and then later shares that their banking login to another user who then proves the same credential. An application that requires users t have some minimum collateral will need to be able to detect if the same bank account is being claimed multiple times.</description>

      <description>To discourage attestors from certifying false claims, we want to make this dishonest behavior as financially risky as possible. While the Reporting Mechanism already provides some such financial risk, even more risk can be added through the Honeypot Mechanism. This mechanism which allows users to prepare trap claims, and attestors who accept a bribe to certify a trap claim will get caught in the trap. Trapped attestors are then charged a penalty, and the penalty is given to the user who trapped them as a reward.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol is available in any format the developer wants to consume proofs on chain. Below are adapters that are used by many dapps.
Check out the demo video or live demo
PolygonID, on Polygon Reclaim Proofs can be created using PolygonID. It can also be stored securely for later use on the PolygonID Wallet.
EAS, on Ethereum, Optimism and Arbitrum Ethereum Attestation Service is a simple attestation framework. One can consume and publish Reclaim Proofs as EAS Attestations.</description>

      <description>Proof of personhood is essential in may dapps including airdrops, DAO voting, and Quadratic funding. However, there are not great solutions to do proof of personhood at scale effectively. Until today.
Existing Solutions WorldID World ID is probably the most well funded startup trying to give a unique ID to every user. However, World ID suffers from three problems - scaling the orbs to several millions so that everyone has access to an Orb, trust on the hardware of the Orb hasn&amp;rsquo;t been compromised or will not be compromised, sharing biometric data as a privacy concern.</description>

      <description>KYC is a loaded term. Depending on your business, jurisdiction and usecase, you&amp;rsquo;d have different KYC requirements. Reclaim Protocol works with various customers across the spectrum. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through some of our customers and how they think about KYC - incase, some of it is suitable to you.
Additionally, a few businesses where KYC requirements are unclear or uncertain - like crypto - we see customers taking the approach of progressive KYC.</description>

      <description>Most apps start with a zerostate for a new user, primarily because there is no data available about the said user. Not any more. Using Reclaim Protocol, app developers can ask their users to import their user profile and activity from a website they already use.
Until today, it was not possible for a user to import their persona from one website into another. This is largely because of unavailability of APIs on most websites.</description>

      <description>The provenance of an object is the history of ownership or the origin or the object. Analogously, the provenance of data is the origin of the data, and the changes that may have been made over time by different owners.
When you access a page on a website, the website sends you data to display on your screen. This data may contain information about you that you would like to share with others, like your age, residency, account balance, number of followers, etc.</description>

      <description>The goal of an Adversary in the Fake Key Reveal attacks is to compute a key such that the result of decryption of the TLS response (that came from the Website) using this key will be a plaintext that contains some specific substrings on the Adversary’s choice. Let’s take a closer look at how the Reclaim&amp;rsquo;s selective disclosure of the Server&amp;rsquo;s TLS response works to understand how these attacks can potentially harm Reclaim:</description>

      <description>By Maxwell Allman
When you log in to your rideshare app, it might say that you’re a 5-star driver. Or when you log in to a banking website, it might say that you’ve never been late on a credit card payment. But how do you prove this information to someone else?
The Reclaim Protocol lets you take ownership over the data that you receive online. Reclaim lets you share your data with others while:</description>

      <description>How Reclaim is Revolutionizing Proof Metrics: A Guide for Forward-Thinking Developers In the context of both Web2 and Web3 applications, there exists a multifaceted need for establishing various forms of proof to address day-to-day use cases. These proofs serve as indicators of user engagement and commitment within digital ecosystems. The following are some key categories of proof, each with distinct criteria and utility:
Proof of Stewardship (Proxy = Holding Toekns): This pertains to individuals who demonstrate care and dedication to the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Reclaim protocol enables various usecases that were previously never possible. It unlocks a new design space letting builders build novel solutions that leverages the identity and credentials of the user - identities and credentials the users have accrued over time all over the internet. If you are building any of these ideas or products in the periphery of these ideas, we&amp;rsquo;d love to support with grants, funding, and engineering.
Verification Usecases Address verification Currently address verification is done in one of the following modes - either by sending a person physically to the said address, or by utilizing addresses on official documentation like national ID, financial documents.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol values user security, privacy and self soverignity. None of the user data is visible to anybody, including the Reclaim Servers, without the explicit consent of the user.
Client Side Proofs All the proofs of identity and credentials are generated using the https sessions. These https sessions are initiated and executed completely on client side. The ZK Proofs are also generated completely on client side. So the data encapsulated within the proofs are held exclusively in the user&amp;rsquo;s device.</description>

      <description>Vitalik published a comprehensive study and opinions on Proof of Personhood here. Though I agree with most of the article, there are a few more points I&amp;rsquo;d like to add.
Proof of Personhood and Sybil resistance Proof of Personhood is a subset of Sybil resistance schemes. A common mistake is to collate the two.
From wikipedia - &amp;ldquo;A Sybil attack is a type of attack on a computer network service in which an attacker subverts the service&amp;rsquo;s reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</description>

      <description>DAOs - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. A phrase that captures the imagination but, so far, lacks in delivery. Today&amp;rsquo;s DAOs are not living up to their full potential. They&amp;rsquo;re often imbalanced democracies, not the advanced, efficient entities we envisioned. But with the Reclaim Protocol, we&amp;rsquo;re on the cusp of a revolution.
The success of traditional corporations lies in their ability to channel capital towards profit-making. However, the user experience, the very essence of their products, is often sacrificed on the altar of profits.</description>

For example, a developer may say that they are one of the core contributors to the Aave Github repository and run a scam on social media. One option is for the social media website to ask users to login using Github on their app, use Github API show a blue tick next to the user if they are a core contributor on the repository they claim to be of.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol can prove that a user opened a certain webpage and the said webpage had some information on it. For example, a user opens their bank account webpage and generates a proof of their bank balance as mentioned on the web page. There are two parts to opening a webpage. The request, and the response. User&amp;rsquo;s privacy needs to be maintained in the request as well as the response. This post is going to talk about how the request is validated yet keeping the request private.</description>

      <description>Using Reclaim Protocol, YCombinator Alum DAO could airdrop NFTs and Tokens only to YC Alumni without needing any website or API change from YC.
YC doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an API to authorize YC Alumni. So, for a DAO that is not directly affiliated to YC, how can it conduct an Airdrop only to YC Founders? Also, how can a YC Founder make sure that they cannot be left out of the airdrop because of censoring or a human error?</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol unlocks unlimited possibilities by making HTTPS verifiable in zero knowledge. If you want to prove to me that you have more than a million dollars in your bank account, how would you do it? One option is you send me a screenshot. However, I cannot be sure that you didn&amp;rsquo;t morph the screenshot. The other option is for you to send me your username password and let me login and check your balance myself.</description>
