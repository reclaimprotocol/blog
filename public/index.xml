      <description>Most apps start with a zerostate for a new user, primarily because there is no data available about the said user. Not any more. Using Reclaim Protocol, app developers can ask their users to import their user profile and activity from a website they already use.
Until today, it was not possible for a user to import their persona from one website into another. This is largely because of unavailability of APIs on most websites.</description>

      <description>The provenance of an object is the history of ownership or the origin or the object. Analogously, the provenance of data is the origin of the data, and the changes that may have been made over time by different owners.
When you access a page on a website, the website sends you data to display on your screen. This data may contain information about you that you would like to share with others, like your age, residency, account balance, number of followers, etc.</description>

      <description>The goal of an Adversary in the Fake Key Reveal attacks is to compute a key such that the result of decryption of the TLS response (that came from the Website) using this key will be a plaintext that contains some specific substrings on the Adversary’s choice. Let’s take a closer look at how the Reclaim&amp;rsquo;s selective disclosure of the Server&amp;rsquo;s TLS response works to understand how these attacks can potentially harm Reclaim:</description>

      <description>By Maxwell Allman
When you log in to your rideshare app, it might say that you’re a 5-star driver. Or when you log in to a banking website, it might say that you’ve never been late on a credit card payment. But how do you prove this information to someone else?
The Reclaim Protocol lets you take ownership over the data that you receive online. Reclaim lets you share your data with others while:</description>

      <description>How Reclaim is Revolutionizing Proof Metrics: A Guide for Forward-Thinking Developers In the context of both Web2 and Web3 applications, there exists a multifaceted need for establishing various forms of proof to address day-to-day use cases. These proofs serve as indicators of user engagement and commitment within digital ecosystems. The following are some key categories of proof, each with distinct criteria and utility:
Proof of Stewardship (Proxy = Holding Toekns): This pertains to individuals who demonstrate care and dedication to the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol can be used to create numerous tools that can fastforward us towards a network state. We are going to be running hacker houses around the world for builders to hack on their ideas for a three to six months with all their basics covered. If you&amp;rsquo;re a builder who is passionate about network states and is building tools to fastforward the future, join our discord and tell us what you&amp;rsquo;re building.</description>

      <description>Reclaim protocol enables various usecases that were previously never possible. It unlocks a new design space letting builders build novel solutions that leverages the identity and credentials of the user - identities and credentials the users have accrued over time all over the internet. If you are building any of these ideas or products in the periphery of these ideas, we&amp;rsquo;d love to support with grants, funding, and engineering.
Verification Usecases Address verification Currently address verification is done in one of the following modes - either by sending a person physically to the said address, or by utilizing addresses on official documentation like national ID, financial documents.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol values user security, privacy and self soverignity. None of the user data is visible to anybody, including the Reclaim Servers, without the explicit consent of the user.
Client Side Proofs All the proofs of identity and credentials are generated using the https sessions. These https sessions are initiated and executed completely on client side. The ZK Proofs are also generated completely on client side. So the data encapsulated within the proofs are held exclusively in the user&amp;rsquo;s device.</description>

      <description>Vitalik published a comprehensive study and opinions on Proof of Personhood here. Though I agree with most of the article, there are a few more points I&amp;rsquo;d like to add.
Proof of Personhood and Sybil resistance Proof of Personhood is a subset of Sybil resistance schemes. A common mistake is to collate the two.
From wikipedia - &amp;ldquo;A Sybil attack is a type of attack on a computer network service in which an attacker subverts the service&amp;rsquo;s reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</description>

      <description>Understanding ZK Proofs is not intuitive. I&amp;rsquo;ve explained how Reclaim Works to over a dozen people spending several hours each, to distill what actually clicks - so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit through one of those sessions filled with banging heads on to the table.
Note, this post deliberately provides incomplete or incorrect information - in the interest of appealing to intuition. For an accurate explanation refer the whitepaper</description>

      <title>Leapfrogging DAOs w/ Reclaim Protocol</title>

      <description>DAOs - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. A phrase that captures the imagination but, so far, lacks in delivery. Today&amp;rsquo;s DAOs are not living up to their full potential. They&amp;rsquo;re often imbalanced democracies, not the advanced, efficient entities we envisioned. But with the Reclaim Protocol, we&amp;rsquo;re on the cusp of a revolution.
The success of traditional corporations lies in their ability to channel capital towards profit-making. However, the user experience, the very essence of their products, is often sacrificed on the altar of profits.</description>

      <description>On any social media it is hard to say whether the user is who they really claim to be. For example, a developer may say that they are one of the core contributors to the Aave Github repository and run a scam on social media. One option is for the social media website to ask users to login using Github on their app, use Github API show a blue tick next to the user if they are a core contributor on the repository they claim to be of.</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol can prove that a user opened a certain webpage and the said webpage had some information on it. For example, a user opens their bank account webpage and generates a proof of their bank balance as mentioned on the web page. There are two parts to opening a webpage. The request, and the response. User&amp;rsquo;s privacy needs to be maintained in the request as well as the response. This post is going to talk about how the request is validated yet keeping the request private.</description>

      <description>Using Reclaim Protocol, YCombinator Alum DAO could airdrop NFTs and Tokens only to YC Alumni without needing any website or API change from YC.
YC doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an API to authorize YC Alumni. So, for a DAO that is not directly affiliated to YC, how can it conduct an Airdrop only to YC Founders? Also, how can a YC Founder make sure that they cannot be left out of the airdrop because of censoring or a human error?</description>

      <description>Reclaim Protocol unlocks unlimited possibilities by making HTTPS verifiable in zero knowledge. If you want to prove to me that you have more than a million dollars in your bank account, how would you do it? One option is you send me a screenshot. However, I cannot be sure that you didn&amp;rsquo;t morph the screenshot. The other option is for you to send me your username password and let me login and check your balance myself.</description>
