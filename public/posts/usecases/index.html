If you are building any of these ideas or products in the periphery of these ideas, we’d love to support with grants, funding, and engineering.\nVerification Usecases Address verification Currently address verification is done in one of the following modes - either by sending a person physically to the said address, or by utilizing addresses on official documentation like national ID, financial documents. Reclaim protocol can help provide the users’ current and active address by verifying daily activities like Amazon orders, food delivery, Uber pickups aggregated over time.\nThis is especially useful for HR agencies verifying the person’s address.\nUnderwriting loans for Amazon, Ebay, Shopify Sellers A lot of data like returns, complaints, rate of growth of sales are all not visible to an underwriter. These are important signals to judge the health of the business. An underwriter can demand this information before extending loans to the seller.\nReclaim can provide the seller’s history and performance in a provable way to the underwriter.\nMatrimony and Dating person verification Misrepresentation is common. Many individuals lie about their profession, wealth and even their real identities. Many matrimony websites in India sell background verification services charging $50-$100 per verification. Many cities have popular help groups called “Am I dating the same guy”, to make sure others in the community haven’t been scammed or abused by the person they’re speaking to on dating sites.\nReclaim can help these dating sites enforce the check so that the other person is forced to prove their claims about their wealth, profession or identity.\nTenant or customer verification in rental services Many house owners are individuals who may not have a dedicated team to do background verification.\nReclaim can enable the owners to request proofs of the customers’ identity and profession.\nFinance KYC’d Defi DeFi needs KYC to get large institutional players to participate. Today, the addresses one is transacting with is completely unknown and no way to ensure compliance while staying fully on chain.\nReclaim can enable addresses to KYC themselves and prove that transacting with them doesn’t violate any compliance requirements.\nInsurance claims 65% of the health insurance claim processing outside the West is slowed down because of the lack of an audit trail of the health records. Patients typically download the reports from their health provider and upload it to the insurance provider. These reports aren’t signed by the health provider. So time and effort is spent in verifying the authenticity of the documents submitted.\nReclaim can attach proofs to the downloaded documents and short circuit the verification process.\nPseudonymity Pseudonymous Identities If a user spins up a new pseudonymous identity, they typically have to start from scratch. They have no way to bootstrap trust with their network. They have to spend several month rebuilding a reputation and proving their skills.\nUsing Reclaim, they can prove that they have certain reputation like followers on social media, their profession, their affiliations etc. They can seed their pseudonymous identity with reputation they can inherit from their other identities. With a single tap a user can spin up a new pseudonymous identity to maintain their privacy when dealing in low trust transactions on the internet.\nSkill IDs Users can pseudonymously publish their skill ids or badges to display their skills using Reclaim. These skill ids unlock opportunities for the user\nMatching talent with opportunities on a gigs marketplace Skill based conversations and connections Broadcasting openness to work at a gig or job Gated inbox based on skills to get access to opportunities Similarly, skill IDs can have subsets like Creator ID, Gamer ID, Freelancer ID, Opensource Contributor ID.\nSome novel usecases P2P onramp/offramp Users can prove a fiat transfer to seller and produce the proof on chain to withdraw crypto from a smart contract. Figma\nGossip Marketplaces Users can share information and opinions that may not be safe to broadcast under a real identity because of professional and social consequences. A marketplace for real and negative reputation becomes possible because of reclaim.\nID gated credit cards Prove your travel on all the ride sharing apps to get a Lyft credit card.
