Reclaim Protocol is available in any format the developer wants to consume proofs on chain. Below are adapters that are used by many dapps.

Check out the [demo video](https://blog.reclaimprotocol.org/posts/usecase-onchain/) or [live demo](https://publish-credentials.reclaimprotocol.org/)

# PolygonID, on Polygon

Reclaim Proofs can be created using PolygonID. It can also be stored securely for later use on the PolygonID Wallet.

# EAS, on Ethereum, Optimism and Arbitrum

Ethereum Attestation Service is a simple attestation framework. One can consume and publish Reclaim Proofs as EAS Attestations.

## Verax, on Linea and Arbitrum

Verax by consensys is an improvement over EAS. A developer can use Verax to consume and publish Reclaim Proofs too. Verax is yet to be released for public use.

## Disco

Reclaim proofs can also be stored on disco.xyz data backpacks.
