Most apps start with a zerostate for a new user, primarily because there is no data available about the said user. Not any more. Using Reclaim Protocol, app developers can ask their users to import their user profile and activity from a website they already use.

Until today, it was not possible for a user to import their persona from one website into another. This is largely because of unavailability of APIs on most websites. For example, LinkedIn doesn’t expose any APIs. All the user activity is stuck within LinkedIn. They cannot use their reputation on LinkedIn to prove their credibility on a new freelancer website or dating app. Reclaim Protocol, lets the users migrate their own data across websites. It lets users Reclaim ownership of their data. It’s always been rightfully theirs.

# Loyalty : Know your own customers better

Many businesses don’t have full visibility on their customers, particularly when users use aggregators to interact with the businesses. For example, the same user might be making purchases from the same restaurant using Doordash, Uber Eats, Google etc. But the business owner doesn’t have a way to connect the purchases across these user profiles across apps. Same is true for hotels. Users might be making bookings from booking.com, expedia, hotels.com, agoda etc. Again, the business doesn’t have full visibility to connect the profiles to one another.

Many customers of Reclaim Protocol are using us to understand their own users better. This is largely by letting users submit their, for example, food purchasing history across various apps in exchange for loyalty points. That is if the user has made a certain number of purchases across various apps - the businesses want to reward them with points and discounts. When the user uses Reclaim, all they need to do is login into Doordash, Uber Eats and whichever apps they use to order food and generate a small proof that will be sent back to the business. Looking at this proof, the business can be sure that the user is a loyal customer.

The businesses know they don’t have to worry about tampering and duplication. That is, there is no way for a customer to generate a proof of purchases that they’ve never made. All the proofs are [cryptographically](https://blog.reclaimprotocol.org/posts/does-it-work/) secured. Also, the business doesn’t need to worry about a customer sharing their username password with all their friends to avail the same discount. This [duplication counting](https://blog.reclaimprotocol.org/posts/usecase-loyalty/%22/duplication-counting.md%22) is trivially handled by the protocol.

# Onboarding & Personalization : Bootstrap a user’s first time experience

When a new application launches they typically have no information about their users. For example, when Amazon launches a new vertical such as Flight Bookings, they have little or no information about a users’ traveling preferences. In such cases, the business can allow their users to import their data from other services they use to bootstrap their experience on this new application.

This can be construed as an vampire attack on competing businesses. This has previously been a [successful marketing strategy](https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/the-blur-blitzkrieg) in web3, the same strategy is now accessible to all apps and websites. Before today, businesses had no way to learn anything about their users on competing apps. Now, upon user’s consent, the user’s profile and activity can be securely ported from one website to another - without needing the permission of business being vampire attacked. This is not a strategy for the weak hearted though! We’re seeing first hand the intensity with which a business needs to move internally and externally to pull off a successful vampire attack. More on this as soon as our flagship unicorn-customer comes out of stealth.

# Look alikes : Find new customers

Some of our customers would love to execute a vampire attack as mentioned above, but fear the PR backlash. In many cases this is a legit concern. Reclaim also helps such businesses sidestep the PR spotlight, and still achieve their goals.

Many customers launch discount campaigns. These campaigns don’t directly vampire-attack their competitors. These businesses know their users inside out. They know exactly what their users’ behaviour is on the internet. What games they play, what shoes they buy, what tv shows they watch. So, instead of asking their users to prove their activity on their competing app, this business just asks users to generate their activity on other apps. This mens fashion app, doesn’t want to vampire attack other, arguably more powerful, incumbents. However, by looking at peripheral data, they can pinpoint to a great degree of certainty the LTV of the user.

Reclaim protocol is particularly good at running these kinds of campaigns - that is, asking users to prove their activity or reputation on certain apps and using that data to give discounts and rewards.
