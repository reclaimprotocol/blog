We are excited to announce a significant security update to our protocol, 
designed to improve the robustness of our Zero-Knowledge proof mechanism for TLS ciphertext. 
This new improvement strengthens the way the claims are proven during each session 
and effectively reduces the risk of tampering, all without impacting performance!

## What is an IV?

In cryptography, an Initialization Vector (IV) is a random (or pseudo-random) value 
used to ensure that encrypting the same plaintext multiple times with the same key 
produces different ciphertexts. It adds an extra layer of randomness, 
preventing attackers from detecting patterns in the encrypted data. 
IVs are especially important in block ciphers, where they help maintain 
the uniqueness of encryption for each session or message. In the case of TLS, 
IV consists of two parts : a part randomly generated in the beginning 
and remaining constant across all IV values during encryption, and the counter part.

## What is New?

Previously, Reclaim Protocol generated independent proofs for each chunk of TLS ciphertext. 
The initial ciphertext was divided into chunks (the size of the block in the block cipher), 
and proofs for different chunks were created and verified independently. 
While this method worked and did not raise any practical security concerns, it raised theoretical concerns 
about the integrity of the connection between different chunks. 
With our latest update, a verifier can be sure that different proofs are connected to each other, 
and so this gap is now closed.

The new update introduces circuits that require a 12-byte nonce as public input, 
adding up to a **128-bit value** calculated on the attestor side. 
This value is derived from a single source per session and acts as a bridge 
between different chunks inside a single proof. Essentially, this nonce value is now a public input in the ZK circuits.

## Why This Matters

Previously, blocks within a TLS session lacked a formal connection beyond the ciphertext itself, 
leaving a (theoretical) vulnerability for attackers to exploit by creating partial collisions. 
This means that, theoretically, a malicious user could generate a different data chunk 
whose ciphertext matched the one sent by the website. But now, with the addition 
of verification of IV by the attestor, each plaintext (and hence, the proof) is inherently bound 
to the session and can be seen as a whole.

In simpler terms, an attacker would now need to brute-force an additional 128 bits 
to break the connection between the blocks, and hence, forge a proof. 
This added computational burden makes the protocol much more secure, 
reducing the risk of tampering or manipulation during transmission.

## Zero Performance Impact

A major highlight of this update is that it significantly boosts security 
**without adding any computational overhead**. The only change is that 
the IV is now a public parameter in the ZK circuits, meaning you get enhanced security 
**at no extra cost**. On the other hand, brute-forcing the additional 128 bits 
requires exponentially more work, drastically increasing the difficulty for attackers 
while leaving protocol performance intact.

## Conclusion

This update represents a significant leap in the security of our protocol. 
By ensuring that each proof is linked to its session through the value of IV, 
weâ€™ve added an extra layer of protection that tightly binds all data chunks together. 
This change will prevent attackers from finding collisions, 
making the protocol much more resilient to manipulation.
