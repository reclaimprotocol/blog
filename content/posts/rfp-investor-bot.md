# Train on DMs
Train a model using an investor's DMs on Whatsapp, Telegram, SMS or Email. Essentially try to figure out what data signals an investor is looking for before agreeing to speak.
This could be a standard self hosted 70B Llama finetuned using DMs.

# A frontend
Host a front end that is a chat interface. This chat interface lets a user chat with the investor's bot. They know they're chatting with a bot.
The bot asks questions and requests data that the investor usually asks for. 

# Submit proofs
When submitting data, let users import data using [Reclaim Protocol](https://reclaimprotocol.org). This could be data from Amplitude, Stripe, MixPanel, Razorpay, Shopify etc. Whatever is relevant.

# Suggest connections
Based on the conversations and based on the datapoints uploaded, suggest what users the investor should get in touch with and why. Be sure to provide the datapoints submitted for the investor to make a manual judgement on whether to get in touch.
