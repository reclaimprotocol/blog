A question I get again and again from devs is -- what can build using zkTLS?
I dug out my telegram today to ennumerate some of these ideas, and added some I wish someone built. 

It really feels like the early days of Ethereum, where the possibilities look endless!

# Fun Ideas, Unlikely to make money :P
## Karaoke Battle
- Two people enter a battle
- They both connect their spotify accounts - share songs they've heard and how often
- Each is given a song from their respective listening history, such that the number of times they've heard the song is approximately the same
- Use GPT to generate a score 
- Disburse prize to the winner
- Bonus : make it on chain!

## Mario Kart, fueled by sweat
- People connect their Strava accounts - how much they've run in that week
- Use those "miles" to upgrade your car
- Have a variety of tracks which require different car powers
- Weekly competitions, bonus if on chain!
_Good reward for a week of running, no?_

## Duo Lingo Chat
- People connect their Duo Lingo accounts - progress they've made
- Connect people with similar progress for a video chat

## Influencer Lounge
- People connect their Youtube/Instagram/Tiktok accounts
- Influencers with similar audience and following grouped into a chatroom
_You get access only if you are an influencer; different groups for different levels_

## Dev builder
- People connect their github, stack overflow accounts
- Get ingame currency for your contributions to open source; Need to figure out the formula though
- Let people build on virtual land using this ingame currency, like [sandbox](https://sandbox.game)
_maybe make money by putting ads in unclaimed land_

# Ideas for Indie Hackers
## Verified Resume
- Let people connect sources like github, stackoverflow, university, current job, national ID
- Auto construct a Resume using these datapoints
- No room for adding any free text
_Everything on this resume is Verified by default_

## TrustBnB
A tool for Airbnb hosts 
- Guest connects their Airbnb, Booking.com, Couchsurfing reviews and bookings
- Generate a trustable score on how trustworthy this guest is
- Let host provide a discount for low risk guests

## ScamCheck
A tool to be used on discord when receiving a message from a new user
- Let users connect a national id that has their name
- When you are contacted by some stranger on the internet, you can send them a link to "scam check"
- The counterparty can generate a proof of their national id to prove their actual name (or maybe just the first name?)

## SkillSearch
Same as the Verified Resume idea in the Fun section, but
- give a way for recruiters to search
- give a way for recruiters to contact the candidate
- have a referral bonus agreement with recruiters
_everything free for candidate, everything paid for recruiter_

## CreditPlus
A credit score that is multi dimensional
- Allow users to connect Credit Scores, Sales on various platforms, Salary, Profession
- Use these datapoints to come up with a more comprehensive credit score that can be used to underwrite lending
_sell to lenders_

## Strict Fitness Trainer
- Let user connect Strava, Fitbit
- Depending on their activity suggest workouts and meal plans
- On weeks where goals are not hit, the meal plans and workout plans are paid

## Reverse Questbook
- Let users create their profile using various sources - like github, hackerrank, job history
- Using the skill extracted from above, match skills with all the open grants on Questbook
_[Contact Questbook for a revenue share!](https://t.me/madhavanmalolan)_

## Taste Maker
- Let people connect their Spotify account and share what they're listening to
- Everyweek have a betting round on which songs will make it to the [top 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/)
- At the end of the week, distribute pool to people who bet weighted by how much they bet _and_ how many times they listened to the song last week
_Ofcourse, take a cut_

# Ideas for potential enterpreneurs
If you're building any of these, we're happy to connect you with our partner incubators. [Contact me](https://t.me/madhavanmalolan).

## DataDAO
There is a rudimentary version of this [deployed here](https://datadaos.reclaimprotocol.org/). 
The basic idea is there, but needs to be refined vertical by vertical and drive traction.
- Customer says "I want so and so data, refreshed every day and I will pay $10"
- Anyone can submit that data on chain, and claim the $10 that is automatically paid out by the smart contract
- Useful for betting applications on chain
- People can earn passive income by running data refresh scripts

## Onchain Judiciary
- Create a fine tuned model or RAG on Llama 3.1 using all the public legal cases
- Two parties enter a legal battle with escrows
- Each party provides a case and supporting evidences 
- Each evidence is valid if and only if there's a proof of its correctness
- Escrows are liquidated in the favour of the winning party, as determined by the LLM

## Paid Inbox
- Let people store all their credentials on a wallet-ish
- They set a price to be contacted
- An advertiser can choose to reach all people with a certain credential, with a budget
- Distribute the message to people's inbox based on credentials and set price
- In the absence of ads, let people participate in group chats

## Decentralized Data collection
- Let people store their profession and demographic information to earn money
- Data collectors, e.g. surveyors, AI model builders, can request people to answer questions only if they have certain credentials
  - A medical image classification can be done only by a professional doctor
  - A survey can be filled only if you live in Paris
  - and so on ...

## TEE Ads 
- Similar to above, but people can reveal their credentials to a TEE
- An advertiser can run more complex ad targetting logic using the credentials available, including look-alikes
_That way, people can be targetted only on datapoints they explicitly decide to reveal_


... more coming soon.
