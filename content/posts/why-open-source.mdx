## What are we solving?

Imagine you've ordered Nike Sneakers online and need to prove it. You might show a screenshot of your order, which works in informal settings where trust exists. However, this method breaks down at scale. For instance, if a business offers discounts to customers who have purchased Nike Sneakers, they can't trust screenshots due to the potential for manipulation.

Reclaim Protocol solves this by allowing users to generate cryptographic proofs of data exchanged over HTTPS connections, making the data on their screen verifiable and shareable.

## Who has this problem?

Real-world examples from customers:

1. A credit card company in India verifying customer addresses.
2. An SME lending company verifying merchant sales before approving loans.
3. A food delivery company trying to poach customers from competitors by verifying their subscriptions.

## Other solutions and their limitations

1. **OCR**: Susceptible to fraudulent screenshots.
2. **Storing username and password**: Creates a security risk.
3. **The new Plaid**: Works for bank accounts but not for other information sources.
4. **Physical Notary**: Limited by physical nature and reliance on human judgment.

## Key Insights

1. HTTPS is end-to-end encrypted using PKI, but uses symmetric keys.
2. Symmetric keys provide security but not authenticity.
3. By knowing the direction of data movement and correct decryption, we can get strong guarantees of information authenticity.

## How It Works

### Proxying

All data is routed through an HTTPS Proxy, which records the direction of data transfer without reading the encrypted content.

### Selective Disclosure

Certain parts of the request and response that are publicly known are revealed:
- For responses: HTTP response code and Date headers.
- For requests: Domain, Path, and Connection headers.

### Zero Knowledge Proofs

ZK proofs are used to prove correct decryption without revealing the key or sensitive data.

### Proving Information

A regular expression is used as a public input to extract specific information from the decrypted data.

## Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### Fake Key Reveal

Mitigated by revealing certain public headers, making it practically impossible to create a fake key that decrypts headers correctly.

### Bribing

Mitigated through decentralization:
- Multiple Proxies are used.
- A consensus is required for proof acceptance.
- An appeal process allows for further verification.

### DNS Poisoning

While not directly mitigated, it's considered an economically infeasible attack due to the need for physical access to proxy servers.

## Implementation

The Reclaim Protocol stack is open-sourced under an AGPL License. Key components include:

### 1. TLS Library

A custom implementation of TLS in JavaScript.

### 2. Attestor SDK (previously Witness SDK)

Verifies the correctness of requests and responses.

#### Request verification:

```typescript
const httpReqHeaderStr = [
    reqLine,
    `Host: ${getHostHeaderString(url)}`,
    `Content-Length: ${contentLength}`,
    'Connection: close',
    // No compression
    'Accept-Encoding: identity',
    ...buildHeaders(pubHeaders),
    ...secHeadersList,
    '\r\n',
].join('\r\n')
```

The headers such as `Content-Length`, `Connection`, `Accept-Encoding` are static values. So, later when decrypting the request the client must be able to decrypt the request such that these requests are decrypted as is. Additionally, the `Host` and `Path` are also revealed so that we can be sure where the request is to be sent. 
Revealing the Host and Path makes it possible for us to verify that certain information came from amazon.com and not a-fake-amazon.com.

#### Response verification:

```typescript
const OK_HTTP_HEADER = 'HTTP/1.1 200'
const dateHeaderRegex = '[dD]ate: ((?:Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun), (?:[0-3][0-9]) (?:Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec) (?:[0-9]{4}) (?:[01][0-9]|2[0-3])(?::[0-5][0-9]){2} GMT)'
const dateDiff = 1000 * 60 * 5 // allow 5-min difference
```

### 3. ZK Circuit

- Capable of decrypting AES-GCM and ChaCha20 ciphers (not AES-CBC).
- 36K constraints when compiled.
- Audited by ZKSecurity.
- Uses Groth16 proof, which is small and can be verified on a blockchain.

### 4. Proxy (aka Node/Attestor/Witness)

- Forwards requests and responses.
- Stores the direction of data movement.
- Provides signatures for verification.

### 5. SDKs

#### Initiating Proofs

1. **Inapp SDKs**: 
   - Available for Flutter (React Native, Kotlin, and Swift in development).
   - Includes a customized Webview.
   - Requires licensing for closed-source software.

2. **Helper SDKs**:
   - JS-SDK for website integration.
   - Uses Instant Apps (Android) or Appclips (iOS) for seamless experience.

#### Verifying Proofs

1. **Backend SDKs**:
   - Node-SDK available.
   - Go and Python support planned.

2. **Blockchain Verification**:
   - Available on major blockchains (Ethereum, EVM L2s, Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot).

## Licensing

- Most components are under AGPL license.
- The in-app SDK requires a license for closed-source projects.
- Closed-source projects need a license from the Foundation and a security audit.

For integration in closed-source projects, reach out to the Reclaim Protocol Foundation for licensing and security audit requirements.
