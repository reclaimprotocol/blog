Using Reclaim Protocol, YCombinator Alum DAO could airdrop NFTs and Tokens only to YC Alumni without needing any website or API change from YC.

YC doesnâ€™t have an API to authorize YC Alumni. So, for a DAO that is not directly affiliated to YC, how can it conduct an Airdrop only to YC Founders? Also, how can a YC Founder make sure that they cannot be left out of the airdrop because of censoring or a human error? Reclaim solves both of those problems.

Using Reclaim Protocol, a founder can login into the YC internal alumni portal and prove that they have access to the portal. This proof is a zk proof. This proof can be used both on chain and off chain.

This has been made using the javascript verification SDK [@reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk). However, the verification can also be done on a smart contract.
